### Goal
The goal of this project is to create a webapp that provides easy to use datamanagement services.
Users can upload their data (from various file formats), share access and divide it into logical 'datasets'.
Furthermore, the app allows for data manipulation in order to make raw data into usable information. Eventually, the idea is to provide sufficiently advanced data cleaning and analysis tools.
